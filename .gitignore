#   According to recommendations in the pipenv docs themselves:

#   "Pipfile.lock is a sensitive file and you might not want to commit it to your repo."
#   However, it is often useful to commit Pipfile.lock to ensure reproducible builds.
#   Comment out the following line if you want to commit it.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is often useful to commit poetry.lock.
#   Comment out the following line if you want to commit it.
